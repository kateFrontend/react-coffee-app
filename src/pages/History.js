        <h1 className="about-title">The History of Coffee</h1>
        <p className="italic">
          No one knows exactly how or when coffee was discovered, though there
          are many legends about its origin.
        </p>

        <h3>An Ethiopian Legend</h3>
        <hr></hr>
        <p className="par-about">
          Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the
          ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says
          the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved
          beans. The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he
          noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree, his goats
          became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night. Kaldi
          reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a
          drink with the berries and found that it kept him alert through the
          long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the
          other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries
          began to spread. As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian
          peninsula, it began a journey which would bring these beans across the
          globe.

        <h3>The Arabian Peninsula</h3>
        <hr></hr>
        <p className="par-about">
          Coffee cultivation and trade began on the Arabian Peninsula. By the
          15th century, coffee was being grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia
          and by the 16th century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and
          Turkey. Coffee was not only enjoyed in homes, but also in the many
          public coffee houses — called qahveh khaneh — which began to appear in
          cities across the Near East. The popularity of the coffee houses was
          unequaled and people frequented them for all kinds of social activity.
          Not only did the patrons drink coffee and engage in conversation, but
          they also listened to music, watched performers, played chess and kept
          current on the news. Coffee houses quickly became such an important
          center for the exchange of information that they were often referred
          to as “Schools of the Wise.” With thousands of pilgrims visiting the
          holy city of Mecca each year from all over the world, knowledge of
          this “wine of Araby” began to spread.

        <h3>Coffee Comes to Europe</h3>
        <hr></hr>
        <p className="par-about">
          European travelers to the Near East brought back stories of an unusual
          dark black beverage. By the 17th century, coffee had made its way to
          Europe and was becoming popular across the continent. Some people
          reacted to this new beverage with suspicion or fear, calling it the
          “bitter invention of Satan.” The local clergy condemned coffee when it
          came to Venice in 1615. The controversy was so great that Pope Clement
          VIII was asked to intervene. He decided to taste the beverage for
          himself before making a decision, and found the drink so satisfying
          that he gave it papal approval. Despite such controversy, coffee
          houses were quickly becoming centers of social activity and
          communication in the major cities of England, Austria, France, Germany
          and Holland. In England “penny universities” sprang up, so called
          because for the price of a penny one could purchase a cup of coffee
          and engage in stimulating conversation. Coffee began to replace the
          common breakfast drink beverages of the time — beer and wine. Those
          who drank coffee instead of alcohol began the day alert and energized,
          and not surprisingly, the quality of their work was greatly improved.
          (We like to think of this a precursor to the modern office coffee
          service.) By the mid-17th century, there were over 300 coffee houses
          in London, many of which attracted like-minded patrons, including
          merchants, shippers, brokers and artists. Many businesses grew out of
          these specialized coffee houses. Lloyd's of London, for example, came
          into existence at the Edward Lloyd's Coffee House.

        <h3>The New World</h3>
        <hr></hr>
        <p className="par-about">
          In the mid-1600's, coffee was brought to New Amsterdam, later called
          New York by the British. Though coffee houses rapidly began to appear,
          tea continued to be the favored drink in the New World until 1773,
          when the colonists revolted against a heavy tax on tea imposed by King
          George III. The revolt, known as the Boston Tea Party, would forever
          change the American drinking preference to coffee. "Coffee - the
          favorite drink of the civilized world." - Thomas Jefferson

        <h3>Plantations Around the World</h3>
        <hr></hr>
        <p className="par-about">
          As demand for the beverage continued to spread, there was fierce
          competition to cultivate coffee outside of Arabia. The Dutch finally
          got seedlings in the latter half of the 17th century. Their first
          attempts to plant them in India failed, but they were successful with
          their efforts in Batavia, on the island of Java in what is now
          Indonesia. The plants thrived and soon the Dutch had a productive and
          growing trade in coffee. They then expanded the cultivation of coffee
          trees to the islands of Sumatra and Celebes.

        <h3>Coming to the Americas</h3>
        <hr></hr>
        <p className="par-about">
          In 1714, the Mayor of Amsterdam presented a gift of a young coffee
          plant to King Louis XIV of France. The King ordered it to be planted
          in the Royal Botanical Garden in Paris. In 1723, a young naval
          officer, Gabriel de Clieu obtained a seedling from the King's plant.
          Despite a challenging voyage — complete with horrendous weather, a
          saboteur who tried to destroy the seedling, and a pirate attack — he
          managed to transport it safely to Martinique. Once planted, the
          seedling not only thrived, but it’s credited with the spread of over
          18 million coffee trees on the island of Martinique in the next 50
          years. Even more incredible is that this seedling was the parent of
          all coffee trees throughout the Caribbean, South and Central America.
          The famed Brazilian coffee owes its existence to Francisco de Mello
          Palheta, who was sent by the emperor to French Guiana to get coffee
          seedlings. The French were not willing to share, but the French
          Governor's wife, captivated by his good looks, gave him a large
          bouquet of flowers before he left— buried inside were enough coffee
          seeds to begin what is today a billion-dollar industry. Missionaries
          and travelers, traders and colonists continued to carry coffee seeds
          to new lands, and coffee trees were planted worldwide. Plantations
          were established in magnificent tropical forests and on rugged
          mountain highlands. Some crops flourished, while others were
          short-lived. New nations were established on coffee economies.
          Fortunes were made and lost. By the end of the 18th century, coffee
          had become one of the world's most profitable export crops. After
          crude oil, coffee is the most sought commodity in the world.
