        The history of coffee dates back to centuries of old oral tradition in
        Africa. Coffee plants grew wild in Ethiopia and were widely used by
        nomadic tribes for thousands of years. Sufi monasteries in Yemen
        employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers. Roasting
        the seeds wasn't a way to serve coffee until the 1400's. During the
        cultivation, brewed coffee was reserved exclusively for the priesthood
        and the medical profession; doctors would use the brew for patients
        experiencing a need for better digestion, and priests used it to stay
        alert during their long nights of studying for the church. Coffee
        later spread to Europe in the early 16th century; it caused some
        controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society.
        Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through
        commercial Mediterranean trade routes, only being served to the
        wealthy. Central and Eastern Europeans learned of coffee from the
        Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East
        Indies. Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by
        the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. In many
        cultures, if you could afford to serve coffee to your guests, it was a
        sign of wealth and power. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee
        in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to
        Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees
        which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like
        Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied
        half the world's coffee. By 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest
        producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period
        since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence
        of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast,
        Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the
        second-largest producer in 1999. Modern production techniques along
        with the mass productization of coffee has made it a household item
        today.
