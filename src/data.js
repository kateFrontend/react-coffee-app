    text: "Everyone is familiar with the way a cup or two of coffee stimulates our energy with its caffeine content. It is invaluable to anyone in a stressful situation who struggles to complete a task when natural energy has drained. However, in common with so many other substances you can have too much of a good thing. There is a huge difference between taking coffee as an occasional energy stimulant and becoming too reliant on the drink. Certain groups also need to be careful about their coffee intake. For example, the UK’s National Health Service advises pregnant women to restrict their caffeine intake to 200mg per day.",

A number of academic studies suggest that regular coffee drinkers live longer than those who do not drink any. These findings are strongly disputed in scientific circles. Some claim that these researchers did not take sufficient account of the different social and economic differences that influence longevity. However, if coffee drinking reduces the risk of disease people will consequently live longer.",
