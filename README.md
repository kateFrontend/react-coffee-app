# Coffee app

## 🦉 Main information

The goal is to create a complete React project.\
The project could have been anything: an online store, a cafe, an application with your favorite films, sites for friends, acquaintances.\
I created a multi-page information site about coffee  built on React.\
Because I really love coffee and drink it every day ))) \
When creating this application, the following conditions were met:
- use navbar and React Router
- make at least 3 working sections of the site with beautifully designed pages
- apply knowledge on filtering elements filter()
- integrate data.js files
- integrate a description of something (goods, services, and so on) and show only the first 170 characters (substring().\
  If we click on "Show more", show all the characters.
- integrate slides on one of the pages
- adapt the project for mobile devices
- integrate other React components as desired


## ⏲️ Run project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
